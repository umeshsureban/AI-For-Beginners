            "**I. Cultural Insights & Local Customs:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Bonjour, Madame/Monsieur:** This is paramount. Always greet shopkeepers, waiters, and even people you briefly interact with (like in an elevator) with \"Bonjour, Madame/Monsieur.\" A simple \"Bonjour\" is sufficient for casual encounters. Forgetting this is considered rude. When leaving, say \"Au revoir, Madame/Monsieur\".\n",
            "*   **Embrace the \"Flânerie\":** The art of strolling and observing is deeply ingrained in Parisian culture. Don't rush from one sight to another. Take your time, wander through the streets, and soak in the atmosphere. Find a park and people-watch.\n",
            "*   **Apéro Culture:** The \"apéro\" is a pre-dinner drinks and snacks ritual. It's a time to relax, socialize, and whet your appetite. Find a local bar and order a glass of wine or a \"kir royale\" (crème de cassis and champagne) along with some olives or charcuterie.\n",
            "*   **Meal Times:** Parisians typically eat lunch around 1-2 pm and dinner around 8-9 pm. Many restaurants close between lunch and dinner service.\n",
            "*   **Table Manners:** Keep your hands on the table (not in your lap) during meals. Bread is usually placed directly on the table (no bread plate). Don't cut your salad.\n",
            "*   **Fashion Consciousness:** Parisians are known for their style. While you don't need to dress extravagantly, avoid overly casual attire (like athletic wear) when dining out or visiting certain establishments. Simple, sophisticated attire is key.\n",
            "*   **Respect for Personal Space:** Parisians generally maintain a greater sense of personal space than people in some other cultures. Avoid standing too close to others in queues or on public transport.\n",
            "*   **The \"Bise\" (Cheek Kissing):** This is a common greeting between friends and family. The number of kisses (usually two, but sometimes one or four) and which cheek to start with varies by region. Don't initiate it unless you know the other person well.\n",
            "*   **Avoid Loud Talking:** Be mindful of noise levels, especially in public transport and restaurants.\n",
            "*   **Don't Expect Iced Water:** It's not common to automatically receive iced water in restaurants. You can ask for \"une carafe d'eau\" (a carafe of tap water), which is free. If you prefer ice, you'll have to specifically request it (\"avec des glaçons\").\n",

            "*   **Montmartre Off the Beaten Path:** Instead of just Place du Tertre, explore the *Musée de Montmartre* for a deeper understanding of the area's artistic history. Walk along the *Rue de l'Abreuvoir*, one of the most picturesque streets in Paris. Visit the *Vignes du Clos Montmartre*, a small vineyard that produces wine each year.\n",
            "*   **Canal Saint-Martin Charm:** Take a stroll along the Canal Saint-Martin, a trendy area with boutiques, cafes, and bars. Consider a boat tour on the canal. *Point Éphémère* is a cool art space and bar located right on the canal.\n",
            "*   **Covered Passages:** Explore the *Passages Couverts* (covered passages), such as Galerie Vivienne and Passage des Panoramas. These historic arcades are filled with unique shops, bookstores, and cafes.\n",

            "*   **Affordable Culinary Delights:** For a truly authentic experience, skip the tourist traps and seek out local \"boulangeries\" (bakeries) and \"pâtisseries\" (pastry shops). Grab a croissant, pain au chocolat, or éclair for a delicious and affordable treat. Enjoy a \"crêpe\" from a street vendor.\n",
